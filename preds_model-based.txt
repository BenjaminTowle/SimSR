not really . i do race my bike though .	haha i say yes . if you really race , you will win .|no . i just do it for fun . what do you do ?|not so much , haha . but i enjoy doing it .|no studying in nutrition . what do you drive ?|i work as an athlete , i do not really like it .|i do . i try to . it keeps my mind active .|yes . i am going to work .|i make a decent wage . sports cars huh ? like fast driving ?|no , i am not really in to games .|yeah , of course i do . how about yourself ?
that seems to be the thing now . so expensive too	you should get one someday . what do you like to do ?|what kind of cars do you have ?|haha . i would probably get those replaced .|i should stop using them . but i save on electricity .|do you sell it ? i am saving money to buy a car .|yes , i guess anything you enjoy doing could be a hobby .|what kind of car do you drive ?|i do not have one yet , i am saving up right now !|good idea . are they expensive ?|i do since they are so low .
so tre . i just wish i did not have to wait tables to get extra money .	it is actually very hard work , but totally worth it .|that is true . somehow a million dollars does not go as far as you think though .|indeed . cars are very expensive !|all of our income goes to raising our kids right now . its so expensive .|yes , but it does not pay very well .|it allows me to save money .|do you work ? i make money that i have not told anyone about .|so what will money do for you when you die ?|if you were rich you would not be saying this .|i know , it is my mission to improve that .
i guess it just really want to be out on my red bike .	that is true but money is tight with me not really working|it allows me to save money .|my job is not very fulfilling , but it does make good money .|yeah . trade your time for to get the bills paid .|its a lot of hard work and i am hoping it will be worth it !|that must pay well . i wish i could work somewhere that pays well .|all of our income goes to raising our kids right now . its so expensive .|we both sound busy . having more money for work we do would help|indeed . cars are very expensive !|i know , it is my mission to improve that .
awesome . maybe we could go out riding together .	staying cool is the key . do not let anyone stress you while driving .|well as long as it makes you happy then keep doing it .|i would do that too if i was retired . it is a wonderful thing|yes . i agree . and i will continue to do so .|i hope so . are you retired now ?|i am retired and love to travel quite often .|when you finish you will be good it will pay off for you .|i wish i had time for that but i have to save money for a car .|i know one day it will be worth it , but yeah , its really hard .|yea that is true . that must be a hard job , but very rewarding .
i have to go , talk to you later .	you definitely want to get on top of that , for sure . are you married ?|i am not sure how that makes sense . but i am going to just go with it .|then you should walk your own path .|well maybe next time you are able to do that .|in my whole life . would love to though . most people do actually .|if it would be easier we could just take one of the cars out . fewer people . maybe ?|i like to keep a good outlook on life .|anyone can do it , you just have to try and keep trying .|i just do not think i could do it . what else do you enjoy ?|we sound like we would get along .
